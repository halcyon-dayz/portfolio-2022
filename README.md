# My Personal Website

## Tech Stack

- NextJS 13
- React
- Typescript
- Markdown (Blog Posts)
- Pages are statically generated
- Projects are pulled from my Github API
- The "Special ❤️" page includes a timer that counts down until my girlfriend's birthday. I'd rather not explain why this is needed.
