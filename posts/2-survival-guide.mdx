# Moving Data Around

> I feel like your story is someone else's survival guide

I've been through a lot in my life. I've survived some pretty close calls.

Surviving Javascript is another thing.

Here's some of the things that I've learned.

`getStaticProps()` is one of my favorite parts of Next.

The React style of passing props around is quite nice. I like to fetch the data that I need, and then use it. Simple as that. API Endpoints make this even easier to use.

This is the way that we send requests. Firebase is incredibly fast and easy to set up, and I've been using it for my projects in production.

I'm currently working on a small project that will do the things I hate the most.

Filling out forms.

Well, I'm actually just making my end users fill the forms out for me.

Then POST that data to the db.

Then I GET that data from the db.

Then I DELETE that data.

Pretty simple?
