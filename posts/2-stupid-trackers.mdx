# Tracking Stuff

<p>I'm constantly trying to keep track of things.</p>
<p>So much, that I keep writing applications to do these things for me</p>

It's probably just faster for me to keep track of stuff like most people do, with a notes app or a pen and paper.

<p>But where's the fun in that?</p>

## Introducing...

Since I work for a large corporation (the one with the Swoosh), it can get busy sometimes. Lots of corporate stuff going on. Meetings, assets being delivered, people doing big corporate stuff.

<br></br>
Life can git a bit overwhelming.

So I created a nice tool that takes some of the pressure off of me.

<br></br>
...And places that pressure on the end user üòÅ
