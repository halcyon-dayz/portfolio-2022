# A letter to potential employers

Christopher Andrews

## Why I am passionate about Software Engineering

I started taking programming classes in High School. I was instantly captivated by the simple functions I could write that would perform complex tasks on the screen. I did not attend University after I graduated High School, but I continued to learn computer science on my own.

<br />
<br />
I am now several years into my journey. Aftert countless hours of reading books,
watching lectures on MIT Open Courseware, and studying docs online, I have built
fullstack applications using Typescript, NodeJS, React, tRPC, and Prisma. I have
taken notes and turned them into blog posts that catalog my self-taught journey,
and I have included them in a personal website that I have been maintaining to
showcase my experience. My journey has not been the easiest, though I believe
that the difficult things in life are usually those worth attaining.
<br />
<br />

### Why I would be a great asset to your team

- I have learned how to think like a Computer Scientist. Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more easily managed components is my specialty.
- I've been able to develop a highly productive developer workflow. I can navigate my editor, execute the most important linux commands, and manage my projects very effectively.
- I publish most, if not all, of my work on [github](https://github.com/halcyon-dayz) and my own personal website, https://topher.codes
- I have made it my priority to learn programming concepts and design patterns, rather than just memorizing syntax and following along with tutorials. I can explain my code very well.
- I have built many frontend UI's, and over the past year I have been focusing on backend technologies to make my apps functional, support users, authentication, and anything else that requires an API layer.

### My only request is fair consideration for an interview

I'd like the opportunity to showcase my skills, and tell you more about myself and my history. I know that I'd be a great asset to any dev team that is passionate about software.
